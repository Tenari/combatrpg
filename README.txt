The game im trying to mull together in my head:
  - is a browser MMOG
  - is a fantasy RPG
  - is 2D pixel-art
  - uses skills/spells trees, unlocked by XP, which allow users to create their class out of the skills they get instead of picking a class at the beginning
  - constrains player action with pardus-like AP system
  - incorporates pardus-like teamwork mechanics
  - has a proficiency tied to each skill which is ln(x) improved by use of the skill, allowing specialization to matter
  - has perma-death
    - you die, you lose all your skills/spells/XP, plus everything you're carrying can be looted
  - gives XP based on relative difficulty of the challenge (which reduces grinding and increases exploration needs since you don't care about killing noobs over and over, but instead try to find rare challenging things to fight/do)
  - rewards non-violent playstyles (trader, crafter, etc)
  - motivates players to squabble over territory
  - combat occurs in fighter-game style realtime button-masher

Play styles:
  warrior
    melee
    range
    magic
  crafter
    smithing
    enchanting
    alchemy
  trader
    mining

too complex ^
